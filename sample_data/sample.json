    "overview": {
      "definition": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.",
      "goal": "The primary goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention and adjust actions accordingly based on patterns in data.",
      "process": "The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future."
