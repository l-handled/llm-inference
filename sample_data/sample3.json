    "overview": {
      "definition": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful and useful way.",
      "goal": "The ultimate goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to process and analyze text and speech data effectively.",
      "challenges": "Human language is inherently complex, ambiguous, and context-dependent, making it one of the most challenging areas in AI."
